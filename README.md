# Fast Checkerboard Demodulation for Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS)
Fast Checkerboard Demodulation for Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS) in python

This is completely based on the work from Sander Wildeman: https://github.com/swildeman/fcd


# Usage
To use pyBOS for a single image or multiple sequence of images, run `pyBOS` as a program via `terminal` or `cmd`.


Run `python -m pyBOS -h` to get usage.

# Dependencies:
Python >= 3.8 and the following packages:

- Numpy
- Scipy
- Opencv-python
- skimage
